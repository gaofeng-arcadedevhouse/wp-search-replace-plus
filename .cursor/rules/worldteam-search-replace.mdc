# WorldTeam Search & Replace Plugin Guide

## Plugin Overview
This is a WordPress search and replace plugin that allows users to search for text in database content (posts, pages, ACF fields) and theme files, with the ability to perform bulk replacements.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Simplified Approach
- **Database Handler**: Uses simple `get_posts()` + `stripos()` approach (like [demo.php](mdc:demo.php)) instead of complex SQL queries
- **No Complex Features**: Removed debug functionality, backup buttons, and plugin file search to focus on core functionality
- **English Only**: All interface text converted from Chinese to English for international use

## Core Files Structure

### Main Plugin File
- **[worldteam-search-replace.php](mdc:worldteam-search-replace.php)**: Main plugin entry point
  - Handles WordPress hooks and AJAX endpoints
  - Loads all required classes
  - Contains activation/deactivation logic

### Admin Interface
- **[includes/admin-page.php](mdc:includes/admin-page.php)**: Admin interface HTML
  - Search form with scope options (posts, pages, ACF, theme files)
  - Results display area
  - Performance settings

### Core Classes
- **[includes/class-database-handler.php](mdc:includes/class-database-handler.php)**: Database search/replace operations
  - **Key**: Uses simple `get_posts()` + `stripos()` for reliability (matches [demo.php](mdc:demo.php) approach)
  - Handles posts, pages, and ACF field searching
  - Simple replace functionality using `str_ireplace()`

- **[includes/class-search-handler.php](mdc:includes/class-search-handler.php)**: Main search coordinator
  - Handles AJAX requests
  - Coordinates between database and file searches
  - Generates search summaries

- **[includes/class-file-scanner.php](mdc:includes/class-file-scanner.php)**: Theme file searching
  - **Note**: Plugin file search was intentionally removed
  - Only searches theme files for security

### Frontend Assets
- **[assets/js/admin.js](mdc:assets/js/admin.js)**: JavaScript for admin interface
  - AJAX search/replace functionality
  - Pagination and result display
  - Form validation and user feedback

## Search Functionality

### Database Search Process
1. Uses `get_posts()` to retrieve all posts/pages
2. Loops through each post and uses `stripos()` for case-insensitive search
3. Searches in: post_title, post_content, post_excerpt
4. ACF fields searched using `get_fields()` if ACF plugin is active

### File Search Process
1. Scans theme directory recursively
2. Searches only in allowed file extensions (php, css, js, etc.)
3. **Important**: Plugin files excluded for security reasons

## Key Features Removed
- Debug information display (intentionally removed for simplicity)
- Backup functionality (removed to reduce complexity)
- Plugin file search (security decision)

## Error Handling Strategy
- Database handler returns empty arrays instead of throwing exceptions
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable (e.g., ACF not installed)

## Performance Considerations
- Limited to 100 posts per search to prevent timeouts
- File size limits (2MB max per file)
- Pagination for large result sets
- Memory management in file scanning

## Localization
- All text strings use English only
- Previously converted from Chinese interface
- Uses WordPress `__()` functions for potential future translation

## Testing Reference
- **[demo.php](mdc:demo.php)**: Working reference implementation
  - Uses same `get_posts()` + `stripos()` approach
  - Serves as reliability benchmark for database search functionality
